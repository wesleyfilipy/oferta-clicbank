										style="text-align: justify; font-size: 5px !important;">Girls, today I'm gonna
										show you the gelatin recipe that went viral after Cheryl Burke lost forty one
										pounds. I was forty one pounds overweight and hated the way I looked, how
										clothes fit on my body until I started eating a cube of Doctor. William Lee's
										pink gelatin before bed. And it changed my life, my body, and restored my self
										esteem. It sounds crazy, I know. But ever since I saw celebrities like Rebel
										Wilson, who lost eighty pounds, talking about how to do this trick with pink
										gelatin and two other household ingredients, I had to try it too. Now
										celebrities such as Jessica Simpson and Kim Kardashian are throwing Mounjaro in
										the trash to melt with this trend. Just take a look at this. Okay, ladies. I
										don't wanna be rude, but if you're not already doing this gelatin trick to lose
										at least twenty six pounds in the next ten days, what the hell are you doing
										with your life? This is the last time I'll talk about this gelatin trick, which
										helped me lose over one hundred pounds after my last pregnancy. I did it and
										lost nine pounds in the first week. And if you can prove to me that you didn't
										lose at least six pounds in a week with this gelatin trick, I'll pay you ten
										thousand dollars out of my own pocket just for wasting your time. Okay? Amazing,
										isn't it? That's what Rebel revealed in an interview with Oprah. And since then,
										this gelatin has become the home remedy of thousands of women looking to regain
										their figure. I lost twelve pounds in just ten days. And after twenty one days,
										I had lost a total of eighteen pounds. Even my doctor was shocked by this
										gelatin trick. It's simply unbelievable. Girls, my boyfriend thought I was
										anorexic after doing this gelatin trick that's going viral on social media. I
										drank every day and my body started burning fat as if I were twenty years old
										again. Do you have gelatin at home and are you ready for the best transformation
										of your life? Perfect. I'll let Doctor. Ashton shares how you can prepare it at
										home to lose two point two pounds in the next twenty four hours. My name is
										doctor Jennifer Ashton. And if you don't know me, let me introduce myself. I'm a
										board certified OBGYN, a Columbia University graduate, and ABC News chief
										medical correspondent appearing daily on Good Morning America and across ABC
										News platforms. I have over twenty years of experience helping thousands of
										patients achieve optimal metabolic health, lose weight in a healthy way, and
										balance their hormones. Throughout my career, I've focused on understanding how
										the body works at its best and how natural methods can help restore hormonal
										balance, reduce body fat, and improve overall health. But what I'm about to
										share now is different. It's a discovery that allows you to lose sixteen pounds
										in ten days and fifty four pounds in three months naturally. No extreme diets or
										magic pills. The secret? A simple approach that turns celebrities with
										impossible schedules into completely unrecognizable people in just weeks. I
										never imagined it would be possible to lose weight this fast, even after turning
										forty. Not even at my peak as an athlete did I achieve this. The bariatric
										gelatin is amazing. Thank you, doctor Ashton. But pay attention. I've prepared a
										special and exclusive gift. The same one I gave Rebel Wilson, Kelly Clarkson,
										and even TV host, Megyn Kelly. But you need to stay with me until the very end
										because every second determines how many pounds you'll lose in the coming days.
										See, every time I share this bariatric gelatin to my patients, I always hear the
										same thing. This is way too amazing to keep just between us. And after I helped
										singer Kelly Clarkson lose over sixty pounds, she sent me a message that led to
										something special happening. Doctor Ashton, I need to propose something to you.
										That recipe you gave me was the only one that actually worked out of all the
										others tried. On top of that, it slimmed down my body in just a few weeks. It
										was the most unbelievable thing I've ever experienced. And I kept thinking, why
										don't we share this with the world together? And to sum up how I came to this
										discovery and the most powerful part of this recipe, I invited Kelly to tell in
										her own words how this transformed her body after she had tried everything else.
										Because when nothing else works, this is what makes the difference. Hello,
										everyone. I'm Kelly Clarkson. I'm forty three years old, and what you're about
										to see is something the media doesn't want you to know. You've known me since my
										twenties on American Idol. Right? So you already know that one of the most
										intense and public battles of my life has always been with my weight. But what
										you don't know is that while I was smiling on stage, I was crying backstage. The
										truth is I've always been very insecure about my body, especially after years of
										being compared to other pop singers. It was always mean comments like lazy,
										careless, no willpower, but I was never that person. I would wake up at five am
										to work out. I ate healthy, avoided sweets, stayed away from fast food, and
										barely drank at all. It was practically a rule. And you know what happened? The
										weight just kept going up. But I decided to put an end to it and do whatever it
										took to lose the weight. I thought, if I have to stop singing for five years to
										fix this, I'll stop. So I literally spent a fortune on three different doctors
										before I met Doctor. Ashton, and you will not believe what he made me do. The
										first doctor charged me fifteen thousand dollars and said Kelly, intermittent
										fasting is the solution. Sixteen hours without eating, eight hours eating. The
										result, I lost fifteen pounds in two months. But when I went back to eating
										normally, boom, twenty pounds back in just three weeks. Then I went to the
										second doctor, and he told me Forget fasting, Kelly. Zero carbs is the secret.
										Twelve thousand dollars later, eating bacon for breakfast and mixing butter into
										my coffee. I lost twenty pounds in six weeks. But do you know what happened when
										I ate a piece of bread? My body went absolutely crazy, bloating, water
										retention. I gained it all back plus ten extra pounds, which was extremely
										frustrating. Then I went to the third doctor. He was well known in the media at
										the time. And, well, this one was the most expensive, twenty three thousand
										dollars. Kelly, I'm going to recommend Mounjaro. This is a guaranteed success.
										And you know what? It actually worked. I dropped an amazing forty five pounds in
										two months, but then the Mounjaro pen ran out. And in just one month, all the
										weight came back. It was like my body had memory. I didn't understand why that
										happened until my friend Rebel Wilson called me. Kelly, I tried all that stuff
										you mentioned too, and nothing worked. But then I met Doctor. Jennifer Ashton,
										and guess what? I lost seventy seven pounds worth of jelly. Yeah. You heard me
										right. Jelly. Doctor Jennifer Ashton is a total genius. It's not a diet. It's
										not some sketchy pill. It's literally a jelly that Seriously, when she told me
										this, I thought she was joking. But believe it or not, I lost sixty pounds in
										three months with gelatin, bariatric gelatin. Doctor. Ashton, please explain to
										us why did none of the other methods work long term? How can bariatric gelatin
										do what? Twenty three thousand dollars worth of medication couldn't. Why did I
										lose weight so quickly this time and it didn't come back? Because folks, this
										changed my life and I need you to understand the science behind it. All right.
										Now I'm going to explain exactly why Kelly Clarkson failed three times and it's
										the same reason she had never been able to lose weight before. Let's start with
										the first method, intermittent fasting, where miss Clarkson had to stick to
										major calorie restriction. The problem is that this slows down your basal
										metabolism, making it burn fewer calories. In other words, you know that story
										about the skinny guy who eats as much or even more than the heavier guy but
										never gains weight? That's because he has a much higher basal metabolism, which
										makes his body a fat burning machine. And because her basal metabolism slowed
										down, when miss Clarkson started eating normally again, her body held on to more
										fat than before. The second method, the famous keto diet, where you must
										completely eliminate carbs while also increasing how much protein and fat you
										eat. You see, the issue with the keto diet is that by cutting carbs, you
										completely screw up how a hormone called insulin works in your body. And just to
										make it clear, insulin is the hormone that escorts blood sugar into your cells
										so your cells can turn it into energy. So when you really think about it, your
										insulin is like a delivery truck and blood sugar is the cargo. But here's the
										part most people don't realize. When you stop eating carbs for too long, your
										insulin stops working the way it should. After all, if there are no carbs, in
										other words, no blood sugar, how is insulin supposed to do its job? It's like
										having a delivery truck with nowhere to pick up or drop off anything. The system
										simply slows down. Then, when you finally reintroduce carbs, even in small
										amounts, your body becomes confused. Your insulin hasn't been operating
										normally, so now it doesn't know how to properly handle your body becomes
										confused. Your insulin hasn't been operating normally, so now it doesn't know
										how to properly handle the incoming sugar. That's when a metabolic rebound
										happens. Your blood sugar spikes higher than expected, your energy crashes, and
										you just start to pack on pound after pound. And let's be honest, who in their
										right mind can do keto forever and live the rest of their lives without bread,
										pasta, cereal, pizza, cake? Now let's move on to the third method, Mounjaro. Now
										I need your full attention because this one is the most interesting. Mounjaro
										has become the most popular weight loss injection and there's a big reason for
										that. This medication provides synthetic GLP-one and GIP, gut hormones that
										regulate appetite and glucose metabolism. Let me explain better. If you're
										trying to lose weight, there are two hormones that make it ridiculously easy,
										GIP and GLP-one. Those names may sound technical, but they are absolutely
										essential for rapid weight loss for a few reasons. GLP-one and GIP are like
										traffic lights telling your body when to stop eating and start burning fat. When
										you eat, it's not your full stomach that tells your body you've had enough. It's
										GLP one and GIP sending that message to your brain saying this body eats
										regularly. It can start using stored fat for energy. When these hormones are
										active, your body knows it's satisfied, knows it will be fed again, and begins
										burning fat even while you sleep. But when you're overweight, your body stops
										producing GLP one and GIP. And when that happens, it panics. It thinks I'm never
										full. I need to store more fat. Food is scarce. It's like your body believes you
										haven't eaten in days and everything you consume, whether it's a lot or a little
										fat or vegetables, sugar, or protein, well, everything just turns into stored
										fat. And then it doesn't matter if you do intermittent fasting, keto, or spend
										hours at the gym. You can eat very little, but your body will still store fat in
										your belly, arms, and neck. And the worst part, you start feeling hungry at
										weird times, craving sweets, feeling tired and anxious because your brain never
										got the I'm full signal and your metabolism doesn't respond. It's like trying to
										drive with a parking brake on. You can press the gas pedal, but your body is
										stuck. The fat doesn't come off. And now comes the most shocking part. A study
										published in JAMA, one of the most respected medical journals in the world,
										proved that people who activate GLP-one and GIP lose up to sixty seven times
										more weight than those who just diet and exercise. That's the secret. In other
										words, without these hormones working, no matter how hard you try, your body
										will keep storing fat in emergency mode. Even if you're eating healthy because
										the root of the problem isn't what you eat, it's what your body stopped
										producing. But doctor, why does Mounjaro cause such a huge rebound when people
										stop taking it? Well, here's what no one tells you. Mounjaro doesn't stimulate
										these hormones, it replaces them. And that's where the big danger lies because
										when you inject synthetic versions of these hormones, your body shuts down its
										own natural production even more. You get stuck in a cycle of chemical
										dependency. Meaning while you're taking it, you lose a lot of weight. But the
										moment you stop, your body shuts down and the weight comes rushing back faster,
										more out of control, and with even more fat than before. That's the infamous
										rebound effect, the same one Kelly Clarkson went through. And it doesn't stop
										there. Mounjaro is a synthetic aggressive drug with a long list of side effects
										from chronic nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain to hair loss.
										Some side effects are similar to other drugs in this class like nausea,
										vomiting, and constipation. However, there are also rare but serious side
										effects including pancreatitis, kidney failure, blindness, and even a black box
										warning for thyroid cancer or severe allergic reaction. Not to mention extreme
										sagging and the dreaded Ozempic face, a sunken, aged, dull face that hundreds of
										celebrities get after rapid weight loss with Mounjaro. And the most serious
										risk, thyroid tumors. And, yes, that's in the package insert. As if all of that
										wasn't enough, it costs up to two thousand dollars a month, a price that drains
										the savings of the average American worker, all just to keep your body
										functioning through an injection. So, yes, it works, but at what cost? That's
										why I wanted your attention for the third method. It's directly connected to
										bariatric gelatin, the method that's helped major celebrities transform their
										bodies quickly, the same method that helped Kelly Clarkson lose sixty pounds of
										fat in three months. But doctor, I've eaten gelatin my whole life and never lost
										weight. Alright, let me explain why bariatric gelatin is so effective for weight
										loss. Have you ever wondered why so many people say gelatin suppresses hunger?
										Why even without significant calories, does it create a feeling of fullness?
										Here's the thing. Gelatin contains two specific amino acids, glycine and
										alanine, that when combined with other bioactive compounds stimulate your own
										intestinal receptors to produce GLP-one and GIP naturally. In other words,
										instead of replacing your hormones, we reactivate your natural production. It's
										the difference between giving someone a fish and teaching them how to fish.
										That's why the results last. Your body learns how to function correctly again.
										And to prove it to you, I'm gonna take you to my lab to show exactly how the
										bariatric gelatin solution works. Take a look at this example. This empty beaker
										represents your body and the soda represents the fat that builds up in your body
										when your GLP one and GIP hormones are low. Now, if I add just a little of this
										solution that contains the bariatric gelatin, watch what happens. The reaction
										you just saw represents that stubborn stored fat being completely melted away by
										your body, all thanks to the increased natural production of GLP one and GIP.
										Isn't that amazing? And the best part is this is your body's natural process. No
										workouts or strict diets needed. And it only happens because of the increase in
										your body's natural GLP one and GIP production, not randomly. You need a very
										specific ratio with extremely precise preparation so that the chemical reaction
										creates the exact formula you need. And that's how you can lose twenty, thirty,
										even up to seventy pounds of fat in just a matter of weeks, no matter your
										genetics or your age. Now that you've seen it work, I'm going to reveal the
										secret formula of bariatric gelatin. A simple solution made with gelatin and
										three other ingredients that naturally activate your body's production of GLP
										one and GIP with zero side effects. Taking you from this to this, the first and
										most powerful ingredient is pure gelatin, but not just any ordinary gelatin you
										find at the grocery store. This one contains concentrated levels of glycine and
										alanine, special amino acids that act like master keys for your metabolism. Now
										listen closely. Remember how I explained that GLP one and GIP are like traffic
										lights telling your body when to stop eating and start burning fat? Well,
										glycine and alanine are like expert technicians who fix those broken signals,
										getting them to work perfectly again. But there's more. A twenty twenty five
										study by the European Chemical Society discovered something surprising. Glycine
										can increase GLP-one by up to one hundred and eighty two percent and alanine
										raises GIP by one hundred and forty four percent. It's like your metabolism has
										been running in slow gear. And these amino acids are the premium fuel that makes
										it speed up again. The researchers were so impressed. They called it the
										cascading metabolic effect because once it's activated, the effect multiplies
										hour after hour. Those who think that gelatin is just a tasty low calorie food
										are mistaken. This small cube contains two powerful weight loss amino acids that
										positively act on the natural production of GLP one and GIP. The second
										ingredient is green tea extract known as the silent accelerator. This extract
										acts like a natural amplifier for GLP one. Imagine your metabolism as an oven.
										The gelatin lights the fire, but the green tea is the fan that makes the flames
										grow. It not only increases GLP-one production, it also stabilizes insulin,
										preventing your body from storing fat. And here's the fascinating part. A study
										in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that women using this
										extract lost twice as much belly fat than women who didn't use it. It's like
										green tea is a GPS telling your body, Hey, burn belly fat first. Green tea
										extract has numerous health benefits, not the least of which is increased
										GLP-one and GIP levels, as well as reduced insulin resistance. The third
										ingredient is concentrated gingerol extract, the active compound in ginger.
										Gingerol has a unique and powerful ability. It activates both GLP-one and GIP at
										the same time. It's like having two light switches in a dark room. The gelatin
										flips one on, the green tea turns up the brightness, and the Gingerol flips the
										second one, lighting up the whole room. The most impressive part is that
										Gingerol also works like a natural thermostat, raising your body temperature by
										up to zero point five degrees, helping you burn calories twenty four seven even
										while you sleep. If you consume ginger every day, you'll transform your body
										into a fat burning furnace. That's because ginger has the power to increase your
										body temperature while activating hormones that burn fat. The fourth and final
										ingredient is turmeric with piperine. In a special combination that's two
										thousand percent more absorbable, turmeric is the guardian of your entire
										transformation. See, it's useless to activate all these hormones if silent
										inflammation in your gut is blocking everything. Right? After age thirty five,
										micro inflammation starts sabotaging your metabolism. It's like having a clogged
										pipe. No matter how much water you pour in, nothing flows through. Turmeric with
										piperine works like a natural drain cleaner, clearing out the inflammation that
										blocks your hormone receptors and making sure GLP-one and GIP keep flowing
										freely. But here's an even bigger secret. This combination is the only one that
										prevents the dreaded yo yo effect. It's like turmeric creates a metabolic
										memory. Your body learns to stay slim even after you've reached your ideal
										weight. The effects of turmeric on weight loss range from destroying
										inflammation to hormonal modulation, making it one of the greatest allies for
										those who struggle with the scale. But it doesn't stop there. Here's where the
										magic really happens. When these four ingredients are combined in the exact
										proportions we discovered, they create what we call the four phase weight loss
										path. Phase one, activation. The gelatin wakes up your dormant GLP one and GIP
										hormones, turning the system back on. Phase two, amplification. The green tea
										and ginger all multiply the effect, speeding everything up. Phase three,
										protection. Turmeric eliminates inflammation, ensuring nothing blocks the
										process. Phase four, transformation. Your body shifts into automatic fat burning
										mode twenty fourseven. It's such a powerful process that patients say things
										like, it feels like someone has swapped my metabolism for a brand new one. I
										lost weight eating pizza. That has never happened before. My doctor couldn't
										believe my lab results and all these results, they happen naturally. No
										synthetic drugs, no side effects, nothing artificial, just reactivating the fat
										burning power that already exists inside you. And that's exactly what happened
										with our dear Kelly Clarkson. Her body switched into automatic fat burning mode,
										letting her melt sixty pounds in three months. But there's a catch about her
										results. That's what I call the ingredient purity issue. Because when you really
										look at Walmart, Costco, Target, you can find glycine, alanine, green tea, and
										turmeric, but you cannot find them in the therapeutic concentrations clinically
										proven to work. Also, ninety nine percent of what's sold is diluted, unstable,
										or poorly formulated. Clinical studies only showed results with standardized
										bioactive versions in exact proportions. Plus, there's a second problem because
										the mixing ratio of these four ingredients has to be precise down to the
										milligram, and most people don't have the equipment to achieve that level of
										precision. Thanks to my graduation and my work on TV, I was able to call a lab
										that had the right equipment and that was also able to make this formula in the
										right way. And right after they finished all the testing, I posted the results
										on my Facebook. I just wanted to share with a few colleagues And the post
										exploded. I posted the results on my Facebook. I just wanted to share with a few
										colleagues. And the post exploded. Twenty four hours, one hundred thousand
										shares. That's when I got a message from the lab that made the first batch of
										the formula, Notori Labs, a Japanese pharmaceutical company specializing in
										scientifically proven natural compounds. They had been researching glycine and
										alanine for years, but had never seen such a powerful application. Two weeks
										later, we signed an exclusive partnership to produce the formula at
										pharmaceutical grade purity. And with revolutionary Japanese technology, we
										developed an ultra concentrated capsule, which made sense. The main ingredients
										came straight from gelatin powder, so it was easier to make it more concentrated
										and put it in a capsule. Plus, the capsules coating works like a second layer of
										protection as the formula moves through your system, helping your body absorb
										even more of it. That's why this format isn't just easier to take. It's also six
										times more effective at activating GLP-one and GIP. This capsule formula was the
										difference between taking ingredients separately and creating a bariatric
										formula that makes it easy to lose weight. The results? Just taking one of those
										easy to swallow capsules can kick off up to fourteen hours of fat burning. This
										is not your typical supplement. This is not store bought gelatin from Walmart.
										It's Japanese technology plus American science. As soon as the first packages
										arrived from Japan, I took them straight to Kelly, and you've already seen what
										happened. I remember the day doctor Ashton told me about bariatric gelatin. I
										laughed. I thought it was just another empty promise, but I had nothing to lose.
										It was so simple. I just needed to take one capsule before breakfast. On day
										ten, my pants started falling off. I stepped on the scale and nearly fell
										backward. Sixteen pounds in ten days. My body had finally woken up. In three
										months, I lost sixty pounds. No diet, no gym, no hunger. The most unbelievable
										part, I kept eating normally. And every morning, the mirror surprised me. My
										belly disappearing, my face slimming, my eyes sparkling. I pulled out an old
										pair of jeans and two of me could fit inside. My social media blew up. Everyone
										wanted to know about the magic gelatin. For the first time, I felt seen for who
										I was. I gained confidence, got married, and found happiness. All of this in
										less than three months. Well, the formula became popular very quickly and I
										think I owe Kelly the credit for that since she made a point of talking about it
										on every TV show. Then other celebrities were suddenly desperate to use it and
										share it with their followers, so I had to import more samples and the results?
										Well, I'll let them tell you what happened. After I had my baby, I lost hope of
										ever getting my body back. The worst part was having to wear baggy clothes that
										hid who I really was. I felt like I'd never feel beautiful again, like that part
										of my life was over. But look at me now. In just two weeks of taking the
										bariatric gelatin before bed, I felt an incredible transformation. My energy is
										back, my patience has improved, and best of all, I've lost fourteen pounds
										without even trying. I can't believe I lost forty one pounds in just two months
										and didn't gain a single pound back. Doctor. Ashton, thank you for introducing
										me to this formula. Two months ago, I was a completely different person. This is
										me today and the transformation is obvious. At that moment, I knew I had found
										my purpose to change the lives of women suffering under an industry that profits
										from excess weight. Because thanks to bariatric gelatin, they were finally free.
										Free to have the body of their dreams without shame, free to eat without guilt
										or judgment, free to live with dignity and self esteem. And you know what makes
										me even more proud? None of them went to the gym or followed a strict diet. They
										just take a capsule that naturally activates GLP one and GIP like Mounjaro, but
										one hundred percent natural and without side effects. And now it's your turn.
										Starting today, your only worry will be buying new clothes. After months of
										negotiations, we secured a partnership with Notori Labs and a GMP certified FDA
										registered facility to produce this revolutionary formula right here in the
										United States. We spent months perfecting it until we reached the flawless
										version. That's now ready to transform your life. I couldn't be more proud to
										introduce you to Citrus Burn. Citrus Burn represents the next generation of
										weight loss treatments, because it's the first and only natural formula
										specifically designed to explode your GLP-one and GIP levels. This way you stop
										storing fat like crazy and you actually start burning it twenty fourseven even
										while you're asleep. Which leads you to drop up to twenty nine pounds of
										stubborn fat in the next thirty days. Throughout my career, treating over
										seventeen thousand patients, I've never witnessed anything as revolutionary as
										citrus burn. While other solution solutions might work temporarily, they
										ultimately rely on sheer willpower alone because with diets and exercise, you
										have to keep doing it forever. Right? So if you crack for just one weekend, just
										one glass of wine, one piece of birthday cake, all that weight comes slamming
										back, usually with an extra five to ten pounds as punishment for daring to be
										human. It's so discouraging, you know, not to mention that as we age, our
										metabolism plummets and diets and exercise alone do nothing to solve that they
										only focus on reducing the calories we consume. That's why the citrus burn
										formula is so unique. It attacks the root cause by naturally soaring GLP-one and
										GF levels in your system. The exact hormones Mounjaro and Ozempic try to
										synthetically in you. This is what rapidly melts belly. Roll back fat and arm
										flab. That's why I'm risking my entire reputation on national TV to say there is
										nothing like citrus burn when it comes to melting fat without becoming a slave
										to needles, starvation, or gym torture. Especially because inside citrus burn
										formula, you'll find not only the glycine, alanine, green tea extract, gingerol
										extract, and turmeric with piperine. I added one more natural component to the
										citrus burn formula, making it even more powerful. That's NAD plus a little
										known coenzyme that is packed with anti inflammatory effects. NAD plus activates
										an army of white blood cells in your immune system, deep cleaning your
										bloodstream from the inflammatory toxins that build up with aging. And that's
										why NAD plus will make you physically become the very picture of youth with
										dewy, radiant, permanently glowing skin. Because once you plummet your
										inflammation levels, your skin heals itself two hundred and eighty percent
										faster. And this is the main factor in reversing sagging skin, wrinkles, and
										fine lines caused by premature aging. So it's very common during the treatment
										for the patient to notice their skin becoming smoother, firmer, and more
										youthful. If you use citrus burn for more than six months, then the
										transformation is almost unbelievable. Seriously, I have patients who send me
										selfies in the middle of the day showing how youthful their skin looks. And
										since you're going to lose a lot of weight, it's essential to use NAD plus daily
										in conjunction with all other ingredients because this will eliminate sagging
										and dead skin that can appear after rapid and drastic weight loss. That's why
										citrus burn is in a league of its own. Every time someone struggling to lose
										weight comes to me, I personally recommend citrus burn, especially the six month
										treatment, because that's the one I saw my patients dropping the most weight.
										Over six months, citrus burn has proven to be better, safer and more effective
										than any other medication or treatment out there. It's more powerful than
										Ozempic and Mounjaro, even when they're used together. Now I need to share what
										makes it even better. You see, I realized one of the main reasons why market
										formulas don't work for everyone is due to one critical mistake. Most formulas
										just slap on a one size fits all dose, no matter your weight, age, or what your
										body really needs. That makes no sense whatsoever. Because whenever you go to a
										good doctor, he prescribes medication with an ideal dosage that varies based on
										your weight, age, and the severity of your issue. Right? So why don't they do
										the same thing when it comes to weight loss supplements? Simple. Because most
										companies don't care if it works, they just care if it sells. They fill the
										capsule, gummy, or drop with the cheapest ingredients they can find, slap a one
										size fits all label on it, and pray you don't ask questions. But with Citrus
										Burn, it's different. I just need you to answer a few quick questions like your
										age, weight, height, and the main symptoms affecting you right now. That way, we
										can personally analyze your case and create a customized dosage specifically for
										your needs. In other words, we analyze your profile, our team of scientists
										craft your personalized blend, and then we rush your citrus burn formula
										straight to your door. So you can start a new chapter of your life now. Let me
										quickly clear up how you take citrus burn the right way. The only thing you need
										to do is take one capsule in the morning, nothing else. It doesn't matter if
										you're thirty, forty, fifty, or even seventy years old. It doesn't matter your
										current weight or your genetics. It's impossible. I repeat, impossible for you
										not to lose at least fifteen pounds in the first month in citrus burn
										consistently, and people who use it are really glad. In fact, thousands of
										people are seeing amazing results with citrus burn. After losing a hundred
										pounds with citrus burn, my biggest fear was putting the weight back on. You
										know, whenever I'm about to film a music video or head out on tour, I just I
										just use the amount doctor. Ashton recommends two weeks before, and my body goes
										right back into perfect shape. It's my little secret for keeping the
										transformation without living on some crazy diet. I can have dinner with my son,
										share a glass of wine with friends, and still walk on stage looking flawless.
										Doctor Ashton honestly saved my sanity and my silhouette. Yeah. I don't stress
										too much about my diet in that sense because whenever I need to drop a few
										pounds for an event, I just use Citrus Burn the way Doctor. Ashton recommended
										about fifteen days beforehand. And I'm slim again. For every ten patients, I
										recommend Citrus Burn with a personalized formula. Nine reach their exact body
										goals faster than with Ozempic or Mounjaro. In the second week after I started
										taking Citrus Burn, I stepped on the scale and nearly fell over, fifteen pounds
										gone. I still can't believe it. One day I was getting out of the shower and my
										husband was sitting on the bed and I caught him looking at me with that look
										like he wanted to pull me in and make love right then and there. Honestly, it
										had been years since I'd seen him look at me like that. All of that changed when
										I started taking citrus burn. So seriously, thank you all so much for
										everything. And I think my husband you too. These videos just show how many lie
										is citrus burn is changing America. And just to make it clear, these people
										didn't need to exercise or diet to lose weight. Most weight loss products are so
										ineffective that they try to compensate for this failure by giving you apps,
										ebooks with rabbit food diets, and exercise classes that leave you exhausted and
										in pain. But with Citrus Burn, you don't need to work out or diet. Of course, if
										you enjoy working out, go ahead no problem. But to lose weight, all our clinical
										trials show that Citrus Burn is more than enough. So there's no app, ebook, or
										classes that you need to do to lose weight. With Citrus Burn, all you need to do
										is take one capsule in the morning and let your body support its natural
										processes, including healthy GLP-one and GIP activity. Many people ask me, are
										there any side effects or people who can't use? Citrus burn is one hundred
										percent natural. It's free of toxins, hormones, and stimulants, and it's
										completely non habit forming. That's why I can confidently say its formula is
										one hundred percent safe, methodically designed to work for women of all ages,
										sizes, and body types, regardless of dietary restrictions. And also FDA granted
										us the seal of confirmed efficacy and safety. So we not only have all the
										registrations to claim it safe, we also proved it safe through rigorous clinical
										trials conducted by the FDA. Another question I get all the time is, how long
										does it take for the formula to act and how long should someone continue the
										treatment with citrus burn. And I know a lot of people get anxious wanting to
										slim down as soon as possible, so I make a point of clarifying that the formula
										indeed starts working from the very first day. In fact, it's very common to
										start seeing your fat melting away. And your gene size dropping within the first
										five days because this is the most important period when you'll be getting
										GLP-one and GIP to healthy levels. But it's by day thirty that you will notice
										the most significant change, especially when it comes to your weight. You'll
										probably burn between fifteen and thirty pounds of fat from your body, just like
										thousands and thousands of women have since Citrus Burn was launched. But it is
										extremely important to use the formula consistently, keeping your GLP-one and
										GIP levels high. In addition, all the patients who continued taking Citrus Burn
										daily for more than six months, experienced not only more consistent and long
										lasting weight loss, but also significant improvements in skin health and hair
										growth, blood sugar levels, sleep quality, constipation, and even joint pain.
										That's why I always recommend treatment for at least six months. This way, you
										ensure that all the pounds you've lost stay off, your body continues to become
										leaner and more toned, your skin becomes smoother and firmer each day, and your
										immune system gets stronger than ever. Now we're in the most important part of
										this video where I'll reveal how you can get up to three free bottles of Citrus
										Burn. Currently, Citrus Burn is only available on our official website where
										you're watching this video. It isn't sold in pharmacies because pharmaceutical
										companies want to increase the price by up to six times, and I think that's
										wrong. Additionally, it is not possible to find citrus burn on online stores
										like Amazon or eBay due to the large number of counterfeit products. Plus,
										getting those three free bottles I told you earlier is not something most women
										can, but don't panic because through this video, you'll be able to do it. And I
										say that most women will not have access to it for a simple fact. Citrus Burn
										actually boosts GLP-one and GIC levels, which means that it actually leads to a
										permanent weight loss. That's why ninety three percent of our customers choose
										the full six month treatment with the six bottle package. They want to make sure
										they're covered for the entire recommended period. And it's no surprise they're
										the ones getting the best results. And since they're seeing fast and long
										lasting weight loss, they end up buying even more bottles of Citrus Burn. All of
										that is awesome. But if ninety three percent of our customers choose the full
										six month treatment with the six bottle package, this leads to high demand
										straining our production capacity, which also leads to frequent stock shortages.
										And since each batch takes up to six months to produce, new customers often
										can't lock in their supply of citrus burn. After all, we're often sold out.
										Also, due to the fact we use the purest and highest quality compounds in
										composition of citrus burn and the fact we tested each compound twice before
										being placed in its bottles. Well, due to all of that citrus burn demands a lot
										of money to manufacture. Initially, the formula was sold to the end customer for
										one hundred and ninety dollars for just one bottle. I saw my sister rushing to
										buy one citrus burn bottle. She paid two hundred dollars in the beginning. I
										thought this was crazy, but then I saw her body after she lost forty three
										pounds. That's why I gave it a shot. So I bought my first bottle for one hundred
										and ninety dollars and within a few weeks I dropped forty seven pounds. Doctor.
										Ashton, thank you. You have no idea how much this changed my life. People were
										paying one hundred and ninety dollars grinning because they knew the results
										were guaranteed. Since then, people have been recommending it to friends, love
										partners, colleagues, and we are grateful to know that thousands of women across
										the country who take their health seriously started placing orders for citrus
										burn every day. So as orders gradually increased, we were able to negotiate a
										lower price for importing the nutrients from foreign suppliers and cut out the
										middlemen, selling directly to the end customer. But instead of maintaining the
										value and profiting from it, as most big companies do, I decided to do things
										differently precisely because our goal was never money. My dream is for Citrus
										Burn to be nominated for the Innovation of the Year Award by the World Health
										Organization. To achieve that, we need at least ten thousand customers. So far,
										we have about nine thousand six hundred. To reach that ten thousand customer
										mark, we've decided to create the Brightbody campaign. Today and until we hit
										our goal, you won't need to pay three hundred dollars for a bottle of citrus
										burn because we managed to reduce the price to sixty nine dollars, and that's
										the current market price of citrus burn today. But as I promised earlier, only
										for viewers of this video, it'll offer a unique deal as part of the Bright Body
										campaign. So here's how it works. When you buy the six bottle kit, you only pay
										for three and get three free, ensuring six months of treatment, which is the
										most recommended option. This way, each bottle of Citrus Burn costs just forty
										nine dollars in the six month treatment plan, saving you more than three hundred
										dollars That's why it's the best choice because in addition to saving money, you
										ensure your body keeps boosting GLP-one and GIP levels, protecting you against
										weight gain for years to come. Now, if you prefer to buy the three bottle kit,
										you only pay for two and get one completely free, guaranteeing three full months
										of treatment. In this case, each bottle costs just sixty nine dollars and you
										save up to one hundred dollars But you can also go with the less common option
										or by reserving just two bottles of Citrus Burn, where you won't receive any
										free bottles, but you'll only pay the manufacturing and shipping cost. Each
										bottle of Citrus Burn costs seventy nine dollars, representing a twenty percent
										discount off the original price. When purchasing six bottles, shipping is on us.
										Okay? Saving you another ten bucks. But there's one thing you need to know. Only
										ten percent of our monthly stock is allocated to the Brightbody campaign. If we
										exceed that quota, I can't keep covering its costs. But please understand, with
										fewer than three hundred and seventy bottles currently left and demand
										skyrocketing, since this video went viral, it's only a matter of time before we
										sell out. If you truly want to regain control of your weight, I advise you to
										act now. Once these bottles are gone, this offer disappears. So if you're ready
										to finally overcome your weight struggles and join the Citrus Burn family, Just
										click the button below. Remember, once we run out of these discounted bottles,
										the price will go back up. So lock in your savings now and start your
										transformation today. That's a lower price than everyone has paid before. And

										you close this page, they'll be released to someone else. So don't waste time,
										scroll down, quickly answer our quiz, and choose the sixth bottle right now. You

										ebooks, workout classes, or any of these useless stuff, but that doesn't mean we
										don't give away some free gifts. In fact, here's the three amazing free gifts

										wondering how we have the courage to offer such a bold guarantee. After all,

										explain why we did this. First, because I know that if you've made it to this
										point in the video, you are a well intentioned person. A person like me who
										wants to live a normal life without judgment, without frustration, without

										refunding your entire investment. We're not here for your money. We want you

										satisfied customers, we know the word will spread and well be rewarded in the
										best way possible by helping even more people. So there is literally no risk for
										you. The risk is all on us. If you're truly committed to becoming your best
										version, just click the button below to take advantage of your discount and join
										our Citrus Burn family at the lowest price ever offered. Now, I need to share
										that there are three catches to this offer. First, this offer is only valid for
										new customers, only for viewers of this presentation, and only for the next
										twenty four hours. If you really wanna get citrus burn at the lowest price we've
										ever offered, you need to act right now. The second catch is since most people
										are ordering six bottles at once, it's quite common for the company to run out
										of stock at certain times of the year. And the reason is we rely on
										international suppliers, and they can't always meet our demand. That's why it's
										almost impossible to produce the necessary batches every month. As a result, it
										can take up to three months for another shipment to arrive in our stock. And as
										you've already seen, all the tests show that if you want to achieve the best
										possible results, it's recommended to use Citrus Burn daily for at least sixty
										days because although it starts working immediately inside your body, the more
										permanent and long lasting results begin after a few weeks of use. That's why I
										always tell our customers that the more you use it, the better your results will
										be. That's why so many people are stocking up on six bottles at once. Because
										after using Citrus Burn for thirty consecutive days and starting to see and feel
										the life changing results, they don't wanna wait another two or three months for
										the new stock to arrive because that kills all your progress and willpower. So I
										always recommend starting with six bottles because it will last for the next six
										months, and you won't have to worry about anything else. You can cancel your gym
										membership, throw all low fat foods in the trash, and stop obsessing over
										calories because you won't need any of that anymore. Now the third catch is that
										after you start using, we ask just one favor. When you start seeing and feeling
										the fantastic benefits it brings to your body, including increased energy
										levels, better skin, more regular bathroom habits, higher concentration, higher
										libido, better mood, and less constipation. And, of course, when you look in the
										mirror twenty, forty, and even sixty pounds lighter, feeling like you're half
										your age, we ask that you tell your friends and family about the product,
										sharing this informative presentation video with them. However, keep the low
										price to yourself because it won't be sold at this symbolic price for long. Does
										that sound fair? I hope so. Remember, with our sixty day money back guarantee,
										you have nothing to lose but the weight. So are you ready to see what life feels
										like when you finally break free from stubborn fat and constant cravings? Then
										click the button below right now to reserve your personalized citrus burn
										treatment. If we still have stock available, after that, you'll be taken to our
										secure order page, which is encrypted with the same SSL technology of the
										largest banks of America, so your data is one hundred percent safe. There, just
										fill in your details correctly, then choose your payment method, and you're
										done. After that, your order will be processed immediately, and you will receive
										an email with your exclusive tracking number. All orders are shipped in a plain
										box for your privacy within twenty four hours and take four to ten business days
										to arrive at your home. Orders for six months supply are treated as the highest
										priority, so don't be surprised if it arrives in two days or less. And as part
										of this special offer for new customers, we will cover the shipping costs for
										orders of more than one month of treatment. We take pride in our excellent
										customer service and are eager to impress you. Our business is built on
										referrals, and we know that if we earn your satisfaction, you won't hesitate to
										recommend our products to your friends and family. If you've made it this far,
										you've seen that everything I've shown you is quite simple, scientifically
										proven, and has already worked for hundreds of women of different ages and body
										types. And you've also seen that there is no risk of disappointment as you can
										try the entire treatment for two months covered by a one hundred percent refund
										guarantee, and you still get the bottles and all the special bonuses forever.
										Think about it. You're getting all of this at a price so low, it's practically a
										gift. We've moved mountains to make citrus burn accessible for everyone. But at
										the end of the day, this choice is yours. Where do you wanna be one, two, or
										even five years from now? Always comparing yourself to other women you don't
										even know, lacking confidence in yourself, not having the courage to wear your
										favorite clothes, or a bikini to go to the beach, always thinking that nothing
										looks good on your body and that others are judging you and even judging
										yourself as inferior compared to other women. Is that really what you want?
										That's not what I wish for you. I want you to see a slim and defined woman in
										the mirror with your relationship thriving, your self esteem through the roof,
										and blood test results that will impress your doctor. And, of course, being able
										to live your life without limitations, wearing the bikini pants and dress you
										want, knowing they will look amazing on your body, a life where you no longer
										have to hide or blame yourself because all you'll feel is pride and self love,
										tearing glances and compliments from everyone around you. I believe there is no
										one better than you to judge what's best to do. Remember, you are the only
										person responsible for your future, and the pain of trying is infinitely less
										than the pain of regret. Click the button below and secure your bottle of citrus
										burn at the lowest price ever before the store closes, and you never have this
										opportunity again. Hey. Still there? I want you to feel one hundred percent
										confident in your decision to place your order today. I've been getting some
										common questions about Citrus Burn lately, and I'd like to clear them up right
										here. I've been taking a few days and I'm already noticing a difference. Is it
										normal to see results this fast? Yes, it's completely normal. Citrus Burn was
										specially formulated to start working quickly on your metabolism. Many users
										experience accelerated fat burning within the first few days of use. If you're
										already seeing results, it means your body is responding very quickly and
										positively to the natural ingredient. I thought delivery would take seven
										business days, but I got my citrus burn in just three. Is that common? Yes, we
										work hard to get your order to you as fast as possible. Although our shipping
										estimate is five to seven business days, it's common for orders to arrive
										earlier, thanks to the efficiency of our logistics team and our optimized
										distribution system. Do I need to change my lifestyle for Citrus Burn to work?
										No. You don't have to change your lifestyle to see the results with Citrus Burn.
										The secret is in its natural compounds, activate the action of GLP one and GIP,

										balanced diet and staying active can help speed up results, but it's not
										required. Does citrus burn work for people with health conditions like diabetes
										or high blood pressure? Yes, citrus burn was developed to help most people,
										including those with type two diabetes or hypertension. Its natural ingredients

										supplement, especially if you have chronic health issues. I'm over fifty years
										old. Will citrus burn still work for me? Absolutely. Citrus burn was designed
										for people of all ages and works both for younger individuals and for those
										experiencing age related metabolic changes. What are the possible side effects
										of Citrus Burn? Citrus Burn is made with one hundred percent natural, safe

																	After I turned 60, the belly fat and low energy got
																	so bad I could barely sleep. Thank God my doctor had
																	heard of LipoLess. He told me to try it every day,
																	and I did so religiously because I couldnâ€™t bear
																	the
																	thought of losing my independence completely. After
																	two months, I can proudly say the stubborn fat is
																	melting away, my energy is back, and I feel free
																	again.

														Dr. Jeniffer Ashton is a board-certified OB-GYN, Columbia
														University graduate, and the Chief Medical Correspondent for ABC
														News, trusted by over <b>17,000 patients</b> and millions of

														nationwide. After years of studying why traditional diets fail,

													</p>
													<p>
														This discovery led her to partner with Notori Labs, a
														Japanese-American research facility, where she developed
														<b>LipoLess</b>, a clinically precise, natural capsule formula
														designed
														to reactivate GLP-1 and GIP safely. By restoring the bodyâ€™s
														hormonal fat-burning system, LipoLess helps melt away stubborn
														fat rapidly and consistently, without diets, workouts, or
														injections.
